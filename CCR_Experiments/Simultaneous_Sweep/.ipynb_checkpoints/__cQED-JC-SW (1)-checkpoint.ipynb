    "\n",
    "By analogy with Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (CQED), circuit QED (cQED) exploits the fact that a simple model can be used to both describe the interaction of an atom with an optical cavity and a qubit with a microwave resonator. This model includes the number of photons in the cavity/resonator, the state of the atom/qubit, and the electric dipole interaction between the atom/qubit and cavity/resonator. As we saw in the last section, transmons are actually multi-level systems, but restricting ourselves to the ground $|0\\rangle = |g\\rangle$ and first excited $|1\\rangle = |e\\rangle$ states is possible because of the anharmonicity of the transmon. Therefore we can describe the transmon as a qubit described by the Pauli spin matrices\n",

    "\\sigma^x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\qquad\n",
    "\\sigma^y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\qquad\n",
    "\\sigma^z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\qquad\n",

    "that generate rotations the respective axes around the Bloch sphere. In that case, the simplest model to describe this interaction is the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian in the rotating wave approximation,\n",

    "H_{\\rm JC}^{\\rm (RWA)}/\\hbar = \\omega_r a^\\dagger a + \\frac{1}{2} \\omega_q \\sigma_z + g(a^\\dagger \\sigma^- + a \\sigma^+).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\omega_r$ and $\\omega_q$ are the frequencies of the resonator and \"qubit\", respectively, $a$ ($a^\\dagger$) is the resonator photon annihilation (creation) operator, and $g$ is the electric dipole coupling (half the vacuum Rabi splitting). Note that we are now omitting the hats from the operators. Here, the first term corresponds to the number of photons in the resonator, the second term corresponds to the state of the qubit, and the third is the electric dipole interaction, where $\\sigma^\\pm = (1/2)(\\sigma^x \\mp i\\sigma^y)$ is the qubit raising/lowering operator. (Note that the signs are inverted from those of *spin* raising/lowering operators, as discussed in the previous chapter).\n",
    "\n",
    "This Hamiltonian can be solved exactly, and the solutions are hybrid qubit/resonator states where an excitation (either a photon in the resonator or excited state of the qubit) swaps between the two at a rate $g$ when they are on-resonance ($\\omega_r = \\omega_q$). For example, the $a^\\dagger \\sigma^-$ in the third term creates a photon in the resonator and lowers the qubit from $|1\\rangle$ to $|0\\rangle$, while the $a\\sigma^+$ term destroys a photon in the resonators and excites the qubit from $|0\\rangle$ to $|1\\rangle$. While interesting, for our quantum computer we want to deal with qubits, and not these hybrid states. This means we want to move to a regimes where the resonator acts as a perturbation to the qubit (and vice-versa), so that their properties merely become \"dressed\" by the presence of the other. Using a type of perturbation theory, called the Schrieffer-Wolff (S-W) transformation, we can calculate the properties of the qubit and resonator in the regime we wish to operate. Here it should be noted that treating the transmon as a qubit is illustrative for pedagogical reasons, but the same techniques apply when you consider all the levels of the transmon. The higher levels of the transmon have profound effects and must be considered when designing and simulating them. "

    "Using the S-W transformation consists of two problems: 1) finding the correct ansatz, and 2) performing the calculations. In most examples, an ansatz of similar form (i.e. anti-hermitian) to the off-diagonal parts is made and confirmed *a postori*. Recently, the manuscript [A Systematic Method for Schrieffer-Wolff Transformation and Its Generalizations](http://www.arxiv.org/abs/2004.06534) has appeared on the arXiv attesting to systematically providing the ansatz and applying it to numerous systems (including the Jaynes-Cumming Hamiltonian below).\n",

Note the hermiticity of $H_0$ and $H_2$ guarantee the anti-hermiticity of $\\eta$ and thus $S^{(1)}$. \n",
